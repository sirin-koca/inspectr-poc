# InspectR Review Summary 260926

The review identified several logical, technical, and functional weaknesses in the InspectR proof of concept. The most important corrected issue concerned the interpretation of human-oversight evidence under AIA-14.

The policy previously treated two fundamentally different situations as the same:

- Human oversight was explicitly disabled.
- No human-oversight information was provided.

These cases have different compliance meanings and must not produce the same result. The Rego policy has now been updated to distinguish them correctly.

## Issue fixed: incorrect AIA-14 classification

### What was wrong

In [`policies/policy.rego`](policies/policy.rego), the policy used:

```rego
object.get(ext, "human_oversight", false) != true
```

This expression uses `false` as the default value when the field is absent. As a result, both of the following inputs evaluated identically:

```json
{
  "human_oversight": false
}
```

and:

```json
{}
```

The policy then returned `HUMAN` in both cases.

### Why this was wrong

The two cases represent different evidence states:

| Blueprint evidence | Meaning | Correct result |
|---|---|---|
| `human_oversight: true` | Oversight is explicitly represented | `OK` |
| `human_oversight: false` | Oversight is explicitly disabled or absent | `FAIL` |
| Field missing | The blueprint does not provide enough information | `HUMAN` |

An explicit `false` is negative evidence. It indicates that the required oversight mechanism is not present. This is different from an absent field, where the system cannot reliably determine whether oversight exists.

Treating both cases as `HUMAN` weakened the evaluation because an explicitly non-compliant component could be presented as merely requiring manual review.

### How it was fixed

The policy now uses a `null` default:

```rego
object.get(ext, "human_oversight", null) == null
```

This allows the policy to detect that the field is genuinely missing.

A separate rule identifies explicit negative evidence:

```rego
object.get(ext, "human_oversight", null) == false
```

The AIA-14 evaluation now follows this order:

1. If any automated decision-support component explicitly has `human_oversight: false`, return `FAIL`.
2. Otherwise, if the field is missing, return `HUMAN`.
3. Otherwise, return `OK`.

### Result after the fix

The bundled extended blueprint contains:

```json
"automated_decision_support": true,
"human_oversight": false
```

It now correctly produces:

```text
AIA-14 — FAIL
Component: prepare_sharing_decision
```

The policy also reports the affected component in the evidence:

```json
{
  "components_without_oversight": [
    "prepare_sharing_decision"
  ]
}
```

## Other issues identified during the review

The following issues were found but were not changed as part of the focused AIA-14 correction.

### 1. OPA executable path is machine-specific

In [`src/evaluator.py`](src/evaluator.py), OPA is invoked using:

```python
C:\Tools\OPA\opa.exe
```

This makes the evaluator dependent on one specific Windows installation path. The application will fail on another machine unless OPA exists at exactly that location.

The error message says that OPA should be available on `PATH`, but the implementation does not actually search `PATH`.

**Recommended improvement:** Resolve OPA through configuration or `PATH`, with an optional environment-variable override.

### 2. The policy path is relative to the current working directory

The evaluator uses:

```python
POLICY_PATH = Path("policies/policy.rego")
```

This works only when Streamlit is launched from the repository root. If the application is started from another directory, the policy may not be found.

**Recommended improvement:** Build the policy path relative to the project or evaluator module location instead of the process working directory.

### 3. `pandas` is missing from the dependency file

[`pages/taxonomy.py`](pages/taxonomy.py) imports pandas, but [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) does not declare it.

A clean installation using the requirements file may therefore fail when the Taxonomy page is opened.

**Recommended improvement:** Add:

```text
pandas
```

to the dependency file.

### 4. Blueprint and policy schema are not fully aligned

The standard bundled blueprint [`data/inlumen-tk-uc.json`](data/inlumen-tk-uc.json) does not contain the `compliance_extensions` fields expected by the policy.

Consequently, the policy interprets the standard blueprint as lacking:

- Logging evidence
- Data-source provenance
- Source approval
- Human-oversight evidence

This may be intentional for demonstrating insufficient evidence, but the distinction is not clearly communicated in the interface.

**Recommended improvement:** Document the difference between:

- A raw inLUMEN blueprint
- An enriched compliance blueprint
- A blueprint with explicit non-compliant evidence

## Validation performed

The corrected policy was validated with OPA:

- Rego syntax check: passed
- Extended blueprint evaluation: passed
- Explicit `human_oversight: false`: correctly classified as `FAIL`
- Missing `human_oversight`: remains classified as `HUMAN`
- Python compilation: passed
- JSON data validation: passed
- Diff consistency check: passed

## Final decision rationale

The correction follows a conservative evidence model:

- Positive evidence can support `OK`.
- Explicit negative evidence must produce `FAIL`.
- Missing or ambiguous evidence should produce `HUMAN`.

This preserves the project's stated principle that InspectR should not claim compliance when the evidence is insufficient, while also ensuring that explicit violations are not incorrectly downgraded to an indeterminate result.

**Current Worktree**

Three source files are modified and unstaged:

- `policy.rego`
- `inspectr_taxonomy.json`
- `taxonomy.py`

No other application files were changed.

**What Changed**

`policy.rego` no longer evaluates EU AI Act rules. It now evaluates the TK/MUNDAT pipeline against five design-time rules:

| Rule | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TK-STRUCT-01` | Checks the seven required TK stages and their graph connections. |
| `TK-DATA-01` | Checks source identifiers and approval status. |
| `TK-TRACE-01` | Checks `has_logging: true` on every node. |
| `TK-RISK-01` | Checks that `run_compliance_checks` exists. |
| `TK-HUMAN-01` | Checks human review evidence before sharing. |

The structure rule checks connections by node IDs, not the order of the JSON `nodes` array. This avoids falsely rejecting valid inLUMEN exports whose nodes are serialized in reverse order.

Human-review behavior is:

- `human_oversight: true` → `OK`
- `human_oversight: false` → `FAIL`
- missing `human_oversight` → `HUMAN`

`inspectr_taxonomy.json` now contains:

- TK pipeline structure;
- MUNDAT data-source provenance;
- DPIA and risk assessment;
- logging and traceability;
- human review before sharing.

Each new executable constraint includes a `rule_id` and `evidence_fields`.

`taxonomy.py` was updated to display TK rule IDs and evidence fields. It no longer displays AIA-specific metadata, and its `st.set_page_config()` call now occurs before other Streamlit commands.

**Current Application Logic**

The application starts in `app.py`.

It:

1. Configures Streamlit.
2. Initializes session state:
   - `blueprint`
   - `blueprint_filename`
   - `evaluation_results`
3. Registers the application pages.
4. Displays the DataPACT logo and global footer.
5. Runs the selected page using `pg.run()`.

The main executable workflow is `evaluation.py`:

1. User uploads a JSON blueprint.
2. The file is parsed with Python’s `json` module.
3. The blueprint is stored in Streamlit session state.
4. User presses `Run InspectR`.
5. `src.evaluator.evaluate()` is called.
6. OPA evaluates `data.inspectr.results`.
7. Results are displayed as `OK`, `FAIL`, or `HUMAN`.
8. Each result exposes its reason, evidence, and remedy.

There is still no Intermediate Representation. The uploaded blueprint is passed directly to Rego.

**Core Components**

- `app.py`: application entry point, navigation, session state, global layout.
- `evaluator.py`: Python-to-OPA integration and result validation.
- `policy.rego`: TK/MUNDAT executable rules.
- `inspectr_taxonomy.json`: machine-readable taxonomy.
- `evaluation.py`: blueprint upload and evaluation workflow.
- `taxonomy.py`: Plotly taxonomy visualization.
- data/: raw, extended, non-compliant, and alternative blueprint files.
- assets/: supplementary rule catalog, currently not used by the runtime.
- images/: diagrams, logos, and page assets.
- tk-uc/: TK use-case documentation, inLUMEN export, provenance, and source documents.

Registered pages include:

- Main
- Overview
- Engineering PaC
- The Semantic Gap
- Use Case
- Research
- Taxonomy
- Architecture
- Evaluation
- Test

`aia_subset.py` exists but is not registered in navigation.

**Current Policy Execution**

The evaluator in `evaluator.py`:

1. Requires the input to be a dictionary.
2. Requires `pipeline` to be an object.
3. Requires `pipeline.nodes` to be a list.
4. Invokes OPA using the hard-coded path `opa.exe`.
5. Loads `policy.rego`.
6. Queries `data.inspectr.results`.
7. Parses the OPA JSON response.
8. Validates that every result contains:
   - `rule`
   - `status`
   - `legal_reference`
   - `reason`
   - `evidence`
   - `remedy`
9. Returns the results to Streamlit.

**Observed Blueprint Results**

The current policy was tested against all bundled blueprints:

| Blueprint | Result |
|---|---|
| `inlumen-tk-uc-extended.json` | Structure OK, provenance OK, logging OK, risk OK, human review FAIL |
| `inlumen-tk-uc-non-compliant.json` | Structure OK, provenance OK, logging FAIL, risk OK, human review FAIL |
| `inlumen-tk-uc.json` | Structure OK, provenance FAIL, logging FAIL, risk OK, human review HUMAN |
| `tk_extended_blueprint.json` | Structure OK, provenance FAIL, logging OK, risk OK, human review HUMAN |

The extended blueprint is therefore structurally valid and contains the expected compliance metadata, but explicitly declares that human oversight is disabled.

**Validation Status**

Passed:

- Rego syntax validation with OPA.
- Taxonomy JSON parsing.
- Python compilation for edited pages and core application files.
- Runtime evaluation of all bundled blueprints.

**Current Limitations**

The app is functional as a PoC, but several limitations remain:

- OPA must exist at `opa.exe`.
- The policy path is relative to the current working directory.
- The evaluator does not validate connections, node fields, or schema versions before invoking Rego.
- Evaluation only accepts uploaded files; there is no built-in blueprint selector.
- Results are reset based on filename rather than file content.
- The evaluation page still contains the text `AIA provision`, although the executable policy is now TK/MUNDAT-specific.
- Several explanatory pages still describe the earlier AIA-oriented PoC.
- The old `TK.PipelineStructure` and `TK.ComplianceRequirements` taxonomy branches remain alongside the new `TK.MUNDATRequirements` branch.
- The policy checks design-time declarations only. It does not prove that the actual data processing, DPIA, anonymization, approval, or sharing operations occur at runtime.

**Overall Status**

The app currently works as a **TK/MUNDAT design-time pipeline inspection PoC**:

```text
inLUMEN JSON blueprint
        |
        v
Python evaluator
        |
        v
OPA + TK/MUNDAT Rego policy
        |
        v
OK / FAIL / HUMAN results
        |
        v
Streamlit evidence and remedy display
```

It now evaluates the TK use-case structure and declared compliance evidence rather than presenting the TK use case as an EU AI Act evaluation.

## Current Rego Rules

The current `policy.rego` implements five rules:

| Rule | What it checks | Source of requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `TK-STRUCT-01` | Required TK stages and graph connections | TK/MUNDAT pipeline design |
| `TK-DATA-01` | Source identifier and source approval | TK data-source and provenance needs |
| `TK-TRACE-01` | Logging declaration on every stage | TK/MUNDAT traceability requirements |
| `TK-RISK-01` | Presence of compliance/DPIA/risk-check stage | TK/MUNDAT compliance process |
| `TK-HUMAN-01` | Human review before sharing | TK sharing and approval process |


These are **not direct GDPR rules and not EU AI Act rules**.

They are **local, technical Policy-as-Code rules derived from the TK/MUNDAT use case**. The policy checks whether a blueprint contains selected evidence needed to support the TK data-sharing process.

## Why the AIA Rules Were Removed

The TK use case is fundamentally about:

- receiving municipal data-sharing requests;
- finding relevant data;
- processing and preparing datasets;
- conducting compliance and risk checks;
- deciding whether and how data can be shared.

The blueprint does not currently establish that an AI system exists. The `prepare_sharing_decision` node is described as decision support, but it does not contain an ML, LLM, or other AI implementation.

Therefore, applying rules such as:

- EU AI Act Article 10;
- EU AI Act Article 12;
- EU AI Act Article 14;
- Article 5 prohibited AI practices;

would overstate what the blueprint demonstrates.

The previous AIA rules were conceptually misaligned because they treated the TK pipeline as an AI Act system without sufficient evidence.

## Rule Explanations

### `TK-STRUCT-01`

This rule requires the following stages:

```text
tk_request_intake
 -> validate_request
 -> retrieve_relevant_data
 -> process_data_for_compliance
 -> run_compliance_checks
 -> prepare_sharing_decision
 -> tk_decision_output
```

It checks:

- all seven required nodes exist;
- the node IDs can be resolved;
- the six expected connections exist;
- the graph represents the required flow.

It intentionally checks graph connections instead of relying on the order of the JSON node array. JSON serialization order is not semantically meaningful.

This rule comes directly from the TK pipeline abstraction created in inLUMEN.

It is not a GDPR rule or an EU AI Act rule.

### `TK-DATA-01`

For each node with `kind: "source"`, the rule requires:

```json
"compliance_extensions": {
  "source_id": "...",
  "approved_source": true
}
```

This represents the TK requirement that data sources should be identifiable, governed, and approved before being used.

The rule is related to data governance and lawful data handling, but it does not implement GDPR Article 5, Article 6, or any other specific legal provision. It is a simplified engineering assumption for the PoC.

It answers:

> Does the blueprint identify where the data comes from, and does it declare that source as approved?

It does not answer:

- whether the legal basis is valid;
- whether consent is required;
- whether the data is actually lawful to use;
- whether the source is legally authorized.

### `TK-TRACE-01`

This rule requires every pipeline node to contain:

```json
"has_logging": true
```

The purpose is to represent traceability across:

- request intake;
- data access;
- processing;
- compliance checks;
- sharing decision;
- output delivery.

This requirement comes from the MUNDAT documentation, which identifies traceability, processing documentation, and auditability as important needs.

It is related to GDPR accountability and documentation concerns, but it is not a complete implementation of GDPR requirements. It only checks that logging capability is declared in the blueprint.

It does not verify that:

- logs are actually generated;
- logs contain the required information;
- logs are retained;
- logs are protected;
- logging complies with data-protection rules.

### `TK-RISK-01`

This rule checks for the presence of a node labelled:

```text
run_compliance_checks
```

The TK/MUNDAT documents describe DPIA and risk assessment at multiple points:

- early in the request process;
- before extracting data;
- after integrating data;
- before sharing data.

The current rule is intentionally narrower. It only checks that the simplified blueprint contains a dedicated compliance-check stage.

It is conceptually related to GDPR DPIA and risk-management activities, but it does not implement a complete DPIA or GDPR risk assessment.

It does not check:

- the actual DPIA content;
- identified risks;
- mitigations;
- residual risk;
- approval by a Data Protection Officer;
- whether assessment occurs at all required lifecycle points.

### `TK-HUMAN-01`

This rule checks the `prepare_sharing_decision` node.

Possible results are:

```text
human_oversight: true
    -> OK

human_oversight: false
    -> FAIL

human_oversight missing
    -> HUMAN
```

This was chosen because the TK documentation describes sharing as a controlled process involving responsible people and, in some cases, higher-level approval.

The rule means:

> The blueprint explicitly declares whether human review or override exists before data sharing.

It does not mean that Article 14 of the EU AI Act is being implemented.

It is a TK governance and approval rule. The terms “human review” and “human oversight” are technically useful here, but the current use case does not establish an AI-specific legal obligation.

## Relationship to TK-UC

The connection is:

```text
TK/MUNDAT business process
        |
        v
Simplified inLUMEN pipeline
        |
        v
Declared compliance metadata
        |
        v
TK-specific Rego rules
        |
        v
OK / FAIL / HUMAN
```

The seven pipeline nodes represent the simplified TK flow.

The `compliance_extensions` fields add evidence that is not present in the original raw inLUMEN export:

```json
{
  "has_logging": true,
  "source_id": "tk_municipal_data_request",
  "approved_source": true,
  "human_oversight": false
}
```

The policy evaluates those declared fields. It does not inspect runtime data or execute the pipeline.

## What Is Actually Implemented

Implemented:

- structural validation of the TK pipeline;
- validation of graph connections;
- source provenance and approval metadata;
- declared logging capability;
- presence of a compliance/risk stage;
- explicit human-review status;
- machine-readable evidence, reasons, remedies, and statuses.

Not implemented:

- complete GDPR compliance;
- complete EU AI Act compliance;
- legal-basis validation;
- consent management;
- data minimization validation;
- anonymization or pseudonymization validation;
- access-control validation;
- data-sharing contracts;
- secure delivery validation;
- actual DPIA evaluation;
- runtime execution;
- actual AI-system detection;
- intermediate representation.

## Final Classification

The current Rego policy is best described as:

> A TK/MUNDAT-specific design-time compliance and governance policy, inspired by documented GDPR-related and municipal data-sharing requirements, but not itself a formal GDPR or EU AI Act implementation.

That scope is appropriate for the current PoC because it demonstrates the InspectR architecture:

```text
pipeline blueprint
+ declared evidence
+ independent OPA/Rego policy
= explainable design-time findings
```

The policy should therefore be presented as an **operational prototype for TK data-sharing governance**, not as a legal compliance engine for GDPR or the EU AI Act.
